# Medical Records Management System

This is a project built with [Chef](https://chef.convex.dev) using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.
You can find docs about Chef with useful information like how to deploy to production [here](https://docs.convex.dev/chef).

This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`tangible-anteater-301`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/tangible-anteater-301).

## Project structure

The frontend code is in the `app` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

The backend code is in the `convex` directory.

`npm run dev` will start the frontend and backend servers.

## App authentication

This app uses [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Google OAuth and email/password authentication.

### Setting up Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" and create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
5. Add your domain to authorized origins (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for development)
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth Client ID
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth Client Secret

## HTTP API

User-defined http routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
